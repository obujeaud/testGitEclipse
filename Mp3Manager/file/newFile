PUBLIC INT READ(BYTE[] B,
                INT OFF,
                INT LEN)
         THROWS IOEXCEPTION

READS UP TO LEN BYTES OF DATA FROM THIS INPUT STREAM INTO AN ARRAY OF BYTES. IF LEN IS NOT ZERO, THE METHOD BLOCKS UNTIL SOME INPUT IS AVAILABLE; OTHERWISE, NO BYTES ARE READ AND 0 IS RETURNED.

THIS METHOD SIMPLY PERFORMS IN.READ(B, OFF, LEN) AND RETURNS THE RESULT.

OVERRIDES:
    READ IN CLASS INPUTSTREAM
PARAMETERS:
    B - THE BUFFER INTO WHICH THE DATA IS READ.
    OFF - THE START OFFSET IN THE DESTINATION ARRAY B
    LEN - THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF BYTES READ.
RETURNS:
    THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BYTES READ INTO THE BUFFER, OR -1 IF THERE IS NO MORE DATA BECAUSE THE END OF THE STREAM HAS BEEN REACHED.
THROWS:
    NULLPOINTEREXCEPTION - IF B IS NULL.
    INDEXOUTOFBOUNDSEXCEPTION - IF OFF IS NEGATIVE, LEN IS NEGATIVE, OR LEN IS GREATER THAN B.LENGTH - OFF
    IOEXCEPTION - IF AN I/O ERROR OCCURS.

        PUBLIC LONG SKIP(LONG N)
              THROWS IOEXCEPTION

    SKIPS OVER AND DISCARDS N BYTES OF DATA FROM THE INPUT STREAM. THE SKIP METHOD MAY, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, END UP SKIPPING OVER SOME SMALLER NUMBER OF BYTES, POSSIBLY 0. THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF BYTES SKIPPED IS RETURNED.

    THIS METHOD SIMPLY PERFORMS IN.SKIP(N).

    OVERRIDES:
        SKIP IN CLASS INPUTSTREAM
    PARAMETERS:
        N - THE NUMBER OF BYTES TO BE SKIPPED.
    RETURNS:
        THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF BYTES SKIPPED.
    THROWS:
        IOEXCEPTION - IF THE STREAM DOES NOT SUPPORT SEEK, OR IF SOME OTHER I/O ERROR OCCURS.

    AVAILABLE

    PUBLIC INT AVAILABLE()
                  THROWS IOEXCEPTION

    RETURNS AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF BYTES THAT CAN BE READ (OR SKIPPED OVER) FROM THIS INPUT STREAM WITHOUT BLOCKING BY THE NEXT CALLER OF A METHOD FOR THIS INPUT STREAM. THE NEXT CALLER MIGHT BE THE SAME THREAD OR ANOTHER THREAD. A SINGLE READ OR SKIP OF THIS MANY BYTES WILL NOT BLOCK, BUT MAY READ OR SKIP FEWER BYTES.

    THIS METHOD RETURNS THE RESULT OF IN.AVAILABLE().

    OVERRIDES:
        AVAILABLE IN CLASS INPUTSTREAM
    RETURNS:
        AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF BYTES THAT CAN BE READ (OR SKIPPED OVER) FROM THIS INPUT STREAM WITHOUT BLOCKING.
    THROWS:
        IOEXCEPTION - IF AN I/O ERROR OCCURS.
